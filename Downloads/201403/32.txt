Subject: Re: maven release-plugin 2.5 bug - releasing snapshots...

Fully agree but with a snapshot not should be treated an release.

The concept of "official snapshots" along with full site info and branch
tagging don't seem wrong where I come from.
If a project going through some stringent QA where formal test teams want to
keep track of what they testing against, then I think some kind of "mile
stone snapshot" have a place.

If on the other hand the only way these projects can keep track of these
"mile stones" releases, then it seem that the only option would be to
release something "official" - in effect clogging the "official" prod state
repo with non prod state content.

I think this bogs down to convenience - maven release process provide a few
steps that makes is fairly simple for developers to deal with and
distinguish between snapshot's and formal releases i.e non tagged release
without the -SNAPSHOT tag

I find it somewhat difficult to understand why earlier versions of the
maven-release-plugin allow for this when at the same time the same plugin
prevent final releases to refer to -snapshot's ?
Fair enough if a line has been drawn between snapshots and formal release,
but the convenience factor seem get lost in the discussion.

Exactly what is the rationale behind allowing a snapshot being released
without the site info and scm branches being created? - apart from this
being a quick release - it's not complete and auditing this release becomes
troublesome lacking scm branch and site info to audit.
These snapshots don;t even have to be committed back to your scm, so what
happens if test teams sign off on such milestone - at the time this is
committed back, the source may have changed.

Personally I think it would be better to release a "mile stone" snapshot
with full information (such as a scm branch and site info being generated
and deployed)

If snapshots (as a concept) is problematic then why not open up for a "mile
stone" snapshot concept ?
A "mile stone" released into the official releases repo is still not to be
treated as a release so no dependencies should be allowed to exists to
snapshot or "mile stone" ref's when you perform an official release.

Another point to make is that a snapshot repo can / and will be cleaned on
regular basis - after all a snapshot *or if "mile stone" snapshot is deemed
as short lived resources never meant for prod.

Have I got this concept completely wrong or do we need to introduce yet more
layers on what we have at our disposal ?

cheers
