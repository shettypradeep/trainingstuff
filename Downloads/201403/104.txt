Hi Curtis,
thanks for answering. Yes, that was the first thing i tried, like you said,
i had done:

cd topPomDir
mvn dependency:list

but that does not print out the same nice report that i see in the
"Dependency Management" section of the generated site, which is what i want.

So, i did:
mvn dependency:list > depsFile.txt
cat depsFile.txt | grep "\[INFO\][^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]*:[^:]*:.*" | cut -d] -f2-
| sort -u > depsFileSorted.txt

to get the unique sorted list, but again, i would have thought there would
be a direct way of doing this.
In the end, i would like to get the Dependency Management report of the
entire project (from the top container pom, like you said) on the generated
website.
That report does not produce the aggregate list of dependencies: i am not
sure what it produces, but that is not it.

So i guess the question is how to get that aggregate report into the site
generation.

With that txt file i create above i get by, but i wished its content got
generated automatically for me with the site and displayed in html like the
other reports. I am not quite sure why the maven site does not already do
that for the top container pom.
