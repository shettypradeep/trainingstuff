Herve,

I'm looking at trying to add this functionality to maven-dependency-tree
but I want to start with a unit test showing the failure. But there doesn't
seem to be any unit tests for the DependencyGraphBuilder (for any
environment).

What's the best way to create a unit test that sets up the environment so
that I can explicitly test the Maven3DependencyGraphBuilder and
Maven31DependencyGraphBuilder?

William
