Doh, well ignore that then. I should have done 30 seconds of searching
before sending that one. :)

But just FYI, when I myself tried accessing that URL last night, I had
problems in my browser. First it was HTTPS problems as the URL did not
match the server name being reported (I have the HTTPS Everywhere
plugin turned on). I clicked "ignore" and went to the site and got
HTTP 404 errors at /log4j/log4j/maven-metadata.xml so I moved up to
/log4j/log4j and had the same errors. I did not grab the error but it
was something related to Varnish cache - when I cause a 404 now, the
error appears different.

So at the very least, the mirror I was on (fastly.net) was having
issues - and potentially this was mirrored to others, possibly
explaining the troubles (??). I had no such trouble hitting the old
standby of repo1.maven.org and resolving the files etc. These errors
made me question the URL entirely.

I hit it again just now and dns sends me to fastly.net again but this
time the files are there.

So, I would ask Richard to try again and see if things work better
today, or if he is having the same troubles.

Wayne
