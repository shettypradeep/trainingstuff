That's a way to general statement to be made  - that also is incorrect   ! 

A snapshot is not allowed for final release - but could still be released
into a shapshot repo for test purposes !
The question really bogs down to how much control you'd like to have against
a release snapshot.
Anyone can in effect release a snapshot into the remote archiva snapshot
repo but no scm branch tag would take place and the source this snapshot was
based on would be unknown since uncommitted data could have been used.

If you go down the path of controlling this (in selected cases) you'd like
to have full control over the source it represent as well be able to assess
the site info linked to this release.

A simple mvn deploy would not do these things - it would only promote a
local build into archiva's snapshot repository - with a lot of ??? to follow
when it comes to QA, source control etc.


I am not trying to do a "*/release/*" as such - it's a legit release of a
*/snapshot/* to be used for test purposed in a highly controlled manner
pending official signoffs - once a signoff is received a proper release for
that version would be performed.

The final release would never be allowed to be a snapshot - nor would any
snapshot dependencies be allowed but that's a side issue and have absolutely
nothing to do with what I am arguing about.

The snapshot release would end up in a dedicated snapshot repository so why
you go down this path I don't really understand - bogs down to how v2.2.2 vs
higher versions of the release-plugin behaves.

I have now done some tests going back in history and it shows that all
versions after *v.2.3.2* (my initial test was on v2.2.2) fails when it comes
to this...

So it appear that v 2.4 onwards all fail when it comes to this
