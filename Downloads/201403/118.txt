Hi,
Let me join this thread, because that "someone" is me. As said by Stephen:  
the version handling prior to 2.4 contained several issues, so you were  
relying on a bug.
This has all been done as part of MRELEASE-511[1] and related issues.

There is no such thing as a "formal SNAPSHOT": it's a formal release or a  
SNAPSHOT, not both.
If you want the release to be formal, use version patterns with alpha,  
beta, milestone or release candidate as supported by Maven (through  
Aether)[2]
If you want to  upload to the SNAPSHOT repository, just "deploy" the  
development version
If you want a tag/branch, either use release:branch, scm:branch or  
scm:tag[3]
Keep in mind: the difference in behavior between a release and a SNAPSHOT.  
And versions are considered cheap nowadays.

thanks,
Robert
