I don't really know: that's a precise feature that I didn't sudy
dependency-tree is used in Maven plugins in contexts where components a=
re=20
already installed: so there is not much difference between reactor reso=
lution=20
and local repository resolution

you're probably right: if reactor resolution is not done, it should be =
added,=20
since that can be something generally expected from the component
