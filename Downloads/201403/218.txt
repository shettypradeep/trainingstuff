You can distribute it in any state that you want.
I was just pointing out that if you need to do something with the tgz 
file at the destination, you can.
If it is ready to be used as a tgz, then you don't need to do anything.

My point is that trying to make Maven build installation packages can be 
more trouble than it is worth and one way around this is to use Maven to 
do the building of the artifacts and use an install builder to make the 
final package that you send t the deploy stage.

iZPack works with Maven so I suggested that one but you can use any of 
the other free (or commercial) installers to replace the part of ANT 
that assembles the various artifacts and resources into a deployment 
package.

You could stay with that part of your ANT process and use the Maven 
ANTRun plugin to initiate the ANT stage.
Not as easy to build as an installer but you already have the script in 
your curent set up.
