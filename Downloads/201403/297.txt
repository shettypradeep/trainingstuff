maven-dependency-tree offers a really simple API: that's its objective.=

The drawback is that it is not very flexible
The value is that it hides Maven 2, Maven 3.0.x and Maven 3.1.x+=20
implementations, which are completely different (initial Maven 2 is mad=
e of=20
listeners, Maven 3 uses Aether and Maven provider, with package changes=
 from=20
Maven 3.0 and 3.1)

If you need more features, I think you'd better use Aether with Maven=20=

Provider: you can look both at maven-dependency-tree source to start an=
d=20
Aether examples to better understand Aether API, which is a lot more fl=
exible<-
>rich<->complex

Notice that your initial code will use latest Aether, then your plugin =
will=20
require Maven 3.1.x minimum. If you want compatibility with Maven 3.0.x=
 and=20
3.1.x+, you'll have to add some reflection magic which might add comple=
xity (it=20
was not so easy to do it in maven-dependency-tree)
If you want Maven 2 compatibility, I would personnally not really think=
 it is=20
reasonably feasible
