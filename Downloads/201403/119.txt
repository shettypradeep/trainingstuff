Unfortunately, that is not a good assumption

The best GSoC applicants are already involved in free software
development, sometimes even doing paid work in an IT department that
overlaps with their GSoC project

In this case, the mentor is not training them, rather, the mentor's
biggest responsibilities are:

a) looking for such good candidates

b) helping them set sensible goals that can be completed within 8-10 weeks

c) reviewing their progress

d) providing resources (e.g. access to build servers)

This whole "uncompensated" emphasis is very biased

People distribute software "uncompensated".  Linux is an example.

You can go and use WhatsApp without paying them anything to send a
message, their company was valued at $16 billion despite the fact they
are "uncompensated" by their users.

Typically, mentors are not getting cash paid by the hour, getting some
kind of value in-kind:

- the mentor has no time or budget to complete some optional piece of
work on their own, like improving their tools, it wouldn't get done
otherwise

- the student is an extra tester for the project and related tools that
are of interest to the mentor
