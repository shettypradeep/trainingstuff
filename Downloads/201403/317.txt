Hi Ron,

In the assembly distribution jar, only file present was MANIFEST.MF and the=
re were no other files. But the jar created from packaging has the .SF and =
.RSA files which indicates that exclude configuration did not work. The dep=
endency jar which I have mentioned in pom.xml is a signed jar and has these=
 .SF and .RSA files.

Thanks,
Suresh

Look in the jar that the assembly created to see if the excludes=20
actually worked.

 I tried commenting one of them and mvn assembly:assembly command worked fi=
