Hi,Occasionally we have a need to perform a formal release on unfinished work
so it can be tracked.These snapshot releases would in effect be releases
identical to a formal release with the exception that the snapshot for a set
release is tagged with a time stamp when released into archiva's snapshot
repository.We used to get around this by issuing the mvn clean
release:prepare release:perform where we overwrite the proposed/suggested
release at the prompt by qualifying the release number followed by appending
"-SNAPSHOT"The build would be done identical to a formal release where the
scm branch is created for the snapshot in  our svn source repo and the built
snapshot would be released into our internal "snapshot" repo (oppose to 
formal non snapshot releases that ends up in the "releases" repo)This used
to work really well but recently I don't seem to be able to overwrite the
version at the prompt - when I do it simple prompts me again
<http://maven.40175.n5.nabble.com/file/n5789837/release-version-prompt-v.2.5.jpg>
It's a weird one - this have been proven to be working previously but
suddenly it don't seem to work any more.The release plugin i currently use
is v2.5 - in the past I used v 2.2.2 successfully.By reverting back to
v2.2.2 of org.apache.maven.plugins.maven.release-plugin this work perfectly
<http://maven.40175.n5.nabble.com/file/n5789837/release-version-prompt-v2.2.2.jpg>
Is this a known issue and is it linked to v2.5 of the maven release plugin
?I can do snapshot releases using mvn clean install deploy but that would
not branch tag the source and would not generate site infoBottom line - does
anyone know how this can be done using the most recent maven-release-plugin?
