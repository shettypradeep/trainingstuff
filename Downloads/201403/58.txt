IMHO, Maven is a software build tool and trying to make it a 
installation tool is much too hard.

You might find that your life will be a lot easier with IzPack as the 
tool to create your installer.
It will allow you to package up your maven artifacts with other 
resources into different OS-specific installers that can be distributed 
easily.
It supports install time execution of your procedures so that you can 
start RED-5 or execute the flex processes required to build and install 
the Flash assets.
