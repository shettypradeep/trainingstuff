Hi,

I'll look into that.

For the last couple of releases I've picked up a specific part of the  
plugin and tried to gather all related issues.
The number of open issues is still huge (and some very old) so it takes  
some time to analyze every issue.
However, this kind of reminders can help.

Robert
