Really? Do you check the other mirrors? I don't think any of us do? We =
should but we don't as far as I know. If it's an official mirror then =
what's the standard? If someone goes "Hey, I want to be a mirror" and we =

we would be none the wiser.=20

I at least know what happens with the current Maven Central machines, =
and I'm reasonably assured of the security. Note I'm not affiliated with =
Sonatype anymore, I just know they have a good IT staff.

So I stand by my claim that I would not use anything but the primary =
because there is no vetting process whatsoever.
