Can you list what you've read so far?
I assume you've gone through the ones we link at the Maven site?
http://maven.apache.org/articles.html

I highly recommend that you sit down locally with your group and write up a
list of questions, and then document them on your internal wiki.
Work through which ones are causing you the most pain (whatever that may
be; confusion, build stability, slow build times, etc)
And after you've done some googling, searched the archives, etc, then come
back and ask the questions individually here.

A lot of the problem you will find when you get to this level is that it's
hard to express the concepts if you haven't already been exposed to them
before.
And we can't give the advice you want because we have to both upskill and
explain options and their alternatives.

Look for blogs by active members of the community, some that come to mind
are (in no particular order):
  * Brian Fox - http://blog.sonatype.com/author/brian/
  * Stephen Connolly - http://javaadventure.blogspot.com.au/
  * Ron Wheeler - http://blog.artifact-software.com/tech/?author=2

And when you think you've found the answers - contribute them back to the
community.
