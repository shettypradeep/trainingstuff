I understand that you have a few (120) repos but once you have made the 
list, it is easy to maintain.
Same as the list of active projects. 1000 is a lot of names to list but 
you probably can find one already existing or make one through a 
partially automated process.

Otherwise it is a clerical task that you can give to a junior tech.
DEPARTMENT_POM ->TEAM_POM -> PROJECT_POM -> MODULE_POM
is more interesting but probably not that hard to manage.

DEPARTMENT_POM ->TEAM_POM is a small list.
You want to eliminate duplicate sub-trees.

Just a suggestion for a non-maven solution. That is one of the 
advantages of using XML in the POM,
You are not restricted to using the application for which the files are 
designed.
There are lots of XML tools - both low level and high level that can be 
applied.
