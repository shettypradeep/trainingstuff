Jim, I reopened the issue for you, but, please note, this was closed
because the issue was created 6 years ago and no one ever submitted a
patch. Hopefully, someone has the incentive to work on this or it will be
closed again. If you find this feature critical to your own work, do you
have time to take a detour and submit a patch?


Cheers,
Paul
