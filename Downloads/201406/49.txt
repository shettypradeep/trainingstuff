Definitely understand the issues, just wish I wasn't short on answers or 
suggestions.  I usually try not to spend much time complaining when I 
have nothing useful to offer up...

As you said, the skills don't usually align.  My own documentation 
efforts are more desperation attempts to not be bothered by things I'm 
no longer working on.  I mentioned in a reply off list some of what I am 
doing now might be possible to offer up, though I'm afraid it will 
likely at least start in one of the same categories I mentioned above of 
being overly specific.  However, it may serve as a useful starting 
point, so I'll see what I can do.

Thank you for the answers below.  That reporting section thing was 
driving me nuts.  Now if I can just figure out why setting 
altReleaseDeploymentRepository and altSnapshotDeploymentRepository in 
the settings.xml file don't seem to actually do anything, requiring you 
to use altDeploymentRepository property instead....
