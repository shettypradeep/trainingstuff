I'll add my cry of despair here as well.  Modern Open Source 
documentation efforts tend be mostly disappointing.  First of all, it's 
never in a nice neat collection.  Second, most of the articles and 
examples supplied by Senior Mentor Google are stale, trivial and 
sparsely explained.  Explanations are rarely more than a statement of 
the obvious (Property: enabled:  true/false - enable or disable 
feature).  The question of WHY is rarely addressed and downstream 
results never.  Even if you do find a well detailed example it is very 
specific (cookbook style) with little explanation of the options NOT 
chosen and why.

I'm running into this right now in fact.  I did some proof of concept 
testing on a bunch of plugins for my group, things looked good and now 
I'm reviewing my configurations and documenting them. I've managed to 
run across a few issues where configurations I plucked off the Internet 
are "working" but don't seem to be valid. At least I can not find any 
documentation for the options I set.  Is it stale documentation?  
Deprecated options?  Just plain wrong examples?  With a configuration 
file like XML which is designed to ignore options it doesn't understand, 
this is even more frustrating.  With rapidly  changing feature sets it's 
maddening.

Actually having access to OLD documentation would help understand the 
difference between the "old but still supported" vs. the "shiny, new 
preferred" way.  I still have not found a good discussion about the 
difference between using the POM reporting section and adding reporting 
plugins to the maven-site-plugin in the build section. All I know at the 
moment is more plugins seemed to work as I expected when adding the 
plugins to the maven-site-plugin in the build section than when trying 
to add them to the reporting section.

For whatever reason, my career has been one of trouble shooting, proof 
of concept and other, very targeted activities.  I almost never do the 
same job or use the same technologies for more than a year or two.  My 
efforts historically rely on being clever, persistent and willing to buy 
every book I can find on the subject. Generally, the modern JavaDoc 
mentality of documentation blows.  If I want to read the source code 
(and I can) I'll write the source code (which I can).  If I have to dig 
in that deep to figure your plugin out, it's not really saving me much 
time is it?
