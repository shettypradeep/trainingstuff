There isn't any particular reason for moving off of Nexus.  We have Nexus
as its the most common repository manager used.  I want to do an evaluation
before we make the decision to go with one or the other and whether to get
the paid version or stick to the free version.  Archiva, Artifactory, and
Nexus are my choices.  Part of the evaluation will be to take a look at our
processes, see where and how we can leverage a repository manager.

Currently we use something that was written internally earlier this
century, in JHTML and JSP, which hasn't been updated since and is difficult
to update and maintain.  I want to modernise by shifting things away from
the home grown solution.  We've got groups using Ant, Maven, and homegrown
Perl based build tools, and Make, and I have no idea what else is lurking
out there.  Some of those will need ways to upload to the repository
manager.

That's the back story to it.
