Sometimes the people implementing things can't see things from a fresh
perspective - they can't unlearn what they already know.

That is why we rely on the community to provide patches - even to
documentation - to help clarify things.
It's a great place to start if you want to get involved - it's where I
started.

We also need people withe skills and desire to improve documentation.
Technical writing and cutting code are orthogonal skills that rarely sit in
one individual.
So if you have someone on your team who can write technical docs then
convince them, your management, etc that it benefits your team to help
improve these docs and give back to the project. It will also help future
projects at your org.

The previous plugin docs are always available they are versioned on the
website.
But they are unlikely to discuss why things were changed.
You might get lucky and find that information in the jira changeset.

That discussion is in the mail archives, but you would have to hunt for it.
If you are using maven 3 then the reporting section no longer works.

You've described my job too.
I tend to write things up not for others but for myself in the future.
I've been surprised more than once to google a problem only to find that I
answered that myself a while ago...
