First the site does not represent the correct state of your release 0.9 
..the page shows 0.3 (http://clashinspector.com/index.html) and some sub 
pages show 0.3-SNAPSHOT 
(http://clashinspector.com/version_clash_details.html) ...
It would be helpfull if an up to date documentation is online...in 
particular if is in Maven central...


First this plugin looks good (the output looks really good), but some of 
the intentions
of the plugin do exist already in tasts of the
maven-enforcer-plugin 
(http://maven.apache.org/enforcer/enforcer-rules/dependencyConvergence.html) 
which exactly checks such dependency convergence problems...and can fail 
a build in such cases....


What i don't understand is the html goal which starts Jersey but does 
not create anything ? The following i got:

[INFO]
Jun 29, 2014 12:50:29 AM org.glassfish.jersey.server.ApplicationHandler 
initialize
INFO: Initiating Jersey application, version Jersey: 2.8 2014-04-29 
01:25:26...
[WARNING] Couldn't open File with default-browser. Please open file 
manually under: 
/var/folders/22/mdbr7dbx7ln66nz3yhrhph_h0000gn/T/clashInspector.html
[INFO] Local ClashInspector-Server running on port 8090. To stop server 
press enter.


Apart from that above i'm not sure it looks like i've found a little 
"bug" cause i have started that against one of my plugins...and compared 
it with the mvn dependency:tree ...

In the output of dependency:tree i found an dependency testng which is 
not listed as an dep in clashinspector output cause testng is defined in 
scope:test...furthermore junit is listed as a dependency with 
scope:compile cause testng is defined as scope:test which is not 
transitive...

But this should be inspected very carefully...handling of dependencies 
in Maven is not a trivial job...

Kind regards
Karl-Heinz Marbaise
