Hi,

I recently published an idea for discovering the source code of Java
projects (e.g. by exploring meta data from pom.xml) and trying to
automatically and recursively build dependencies (including plugins)
from source

https://wiki.debian.org/SummerOfCode2014/Projects#SummerOfCode2014.2FProjects.2FRecursively_building_Java_dependencies_from_source.Recursively_building_Java_dependencies_from_source

This would satisfy various objectives, for example:

- automated construction of Debian/Ubuntu/RPM packages
- ensuring that non-free components don't creep into the dependency tree
of projects that aim to be published under a free license
- ensuring that 100% of dependency code can be passed through code
quality/security scanning tools (this is a common requirement for larger
corporations when evaluating whether to use a free software project)

I have some plans for how this project could be broken down into
achievable tasks for a GSoC student but to go ahead it would need at
least one additional mentor, mainly because Google has accepted the
Ganglia organisation this year and I am one of the admins for Ganglia. 
The project has been proposed under Debian (mainly as a way of enabling
the creation of more Debian packages) but it could also be completed
under another organisation.  Please feel free to email me privately if
you may be interested.

Regards,

Daniel
