I don't believe that this is a viable scheme.

Maven source artifacts are not generally buildable, but are aimed at
IDEs for debugging visibility. You can't trust the SVM info, and you
don't know what -P/-D options were used to make the binary. We would
need a new train of metadata. This will only lead to more of the
horrible pattern of distro people mis-building Maven and Maven
artifacts, leading to confused users and bug reports when they expect
these things to work right. Maven was not designed to facilitate the
Debian pattern. If someone wants to move in that direction, they
should join the dev community, watch for work on Maven 4, and advocate
(and volunteer to code) solutions to provide the right metadata to do
this. Thowing an inexperienced student into trying to do this with
Maven 3 in a summer is a recipe for failure.
