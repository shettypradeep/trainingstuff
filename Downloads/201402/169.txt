I would suggest you take this issue up with Sonatype, who maintain central
and it's indexing

Also before completely blaming Sonatype I would suggest you find out
exactly when POI released the staging repo on repository.a.o as it only
gets synced to central IIRC up to 8h after being promoted on the ASF nexus
instance

This is in my opinion a bug, or at least a fundamental design error.
