Ron, Wayne,

this wasted several days (elapsed) of my time:
I spent ages trying out options & trying to figure out what I'd done
wrong...
...rebuilding & updating indices, hacking through to
workspace\.metadata\.plugins\org.eclipse.m2e.logback.configuration,
to set logging to ALL, but even ALL  was somewhat sparse.
I tried Google & found loads of hits that had nothing to do with it.
I found nothing at apache maven or maven central or m2eclipse.
I tried the POI Forum, but it became clear that wasn't the problem.

As Wayne rightly points out "where is the right place to document it?".
With a complex issue like this with multiple components where do you start?
But thats all the more reason to document it somewhere...

Right now it seems to me not to be a maven problem as such.
Its about how maven central creates its indices & how m2e uses them.
So in theory it needs to be documented in both, correspondingly
cross-referenced.
But as the m2e FAQ is subscription-only it would seem the only place is the
maven central FAQ.  And its so important, it should be a point in its
own right:

"Why can't I see new artifacts in my client (e.g. m2eclipse)?"
(Tip -> you can get as-yet-unindexed artifacts explicitly...blah, blah)

And then there's the question, why does m2e use the high-latency index?
If its performance/server-load, then it could be
a rethink of the index-structure is necessary.
Is that a maven issue?
I have some ideas there...

All the best,
DaveLaw
