M2E is not Maven per-se. When a question is about a particular tool, I'd
advice you to try and target the most specific ML/support system:
https://eclipse.org/m2e/support/

Again, not the best ML to discuss it.

Definitely not Maven related. Maven core has nothing to do with the indexes
you describe, doesn't know/need it.
It's more an IDE/search engine facility to help people find versions. I
personally almost never use those for example.
