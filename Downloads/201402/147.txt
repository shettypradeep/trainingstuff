In this sort of case, it is helpful to do more tests to narrow things down.
Maybe I missed it elsewhere in the thread, but did you actually try
building from the command line, to eliminate M2E from the equation? Of
course, it is too late now, since 3.10-FINAL is already indexed in Central
at this point, but if you encounter the issue again, would be worth a shot.

FWIW, my team has a hacky way to force Nexus to update its cache for a
given proxy repository; see:
https://github.com/scijava/scijava-scripts/blob/c7fadf95eae7a231ed729fc7a1b23c6a2944ee12/maven-helper.sh#L195

Basically it just deletes the maven-metadata.xml and artifact JAR out of
the /service/local/data_cache/repositories/*/content area, so that the next
time that information is requested, Nexus is forced to query upstream
immediately. Without this hack, we were not seeing our new releases on OSS
Sonatype trickle down to our Nexus right away.

Regards,
Curtis
