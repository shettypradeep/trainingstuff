Hi,

Isn't it the other way around?
There's only a critical situation: when the maven-release-plugin has  =

committed the non-SNAPSHOT poms or when it is busy tagging. In such case=
s  =

the CI can be triggered by SCM changes, but it shouldn't continue since =
 =

there's a final version.
I think most CI's have a solution for that. If you want to do it with an=
  =

enforcer rule, it's not there yet. This requiresSnapshot rule should be =
 =

active by default, while the m-release-p should disable this rule.

Robert
