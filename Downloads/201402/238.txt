Is it possible that you have more than 1 version of Java installed?
I use Eclipse/STS,  have all the Maven tools that I need to build with 
Maven so I may suggest some things that you may not have, with m2 
installed separately.

1) Look in the project properties and make sure that you have nothing 
specified as a library besides Maven dependencies. (libraries might be 
configured in Eclipse that you are not setting in other builds)
2) Make sure that you do not allow Eclipse to use other project 
workspaces for resolution of dependencies.(Eclipse will look in other 
eclipse projects to find dependencies).
3) Make sure that you are using the "right" java compiler from Eclipse. 
It is easy to get different compilers in play.


If you do all this, you may find that your Eclipse build fails in the 
same way that your other builds fail.
You can then fix them both up to be the same.

I hope that this helps.
