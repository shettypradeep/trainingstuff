While Benson is right about -source artifacts (not meant for rebuilding),
this resembles me to M2E's "Project Materialisation", where based on POM of
the given project (is fetched during dependency resolution), and IF the SCM
metadata are okay, etc, the project tag is checked out into workspace....
