Just to clarify some aspects of this:

- there is no expectation that the project will build 100% of artifacts
that are available in the Central Repository - just being able to build
20% of them would still be helpful

- it is expected that some projects will need manual clues to build -
for example, if some project contains two binary JARs in github, and if
they don't have clues about where to find source, the system will
display a report (including the names of classes in the JARs) and the
user will be able to tell it where to look and then the automated stuff
continues.  It will always keep trying to go as far as it can
automatically and then display a list of all things that need manual
help so the user can address them all in a batch.

- I wasn't anticipating a dependency on -source JARs, although the
toolkit that I am proposing may well try to build from them if it has
nothing else (but without any expectation that they will build)

- automatically submitting the packages to Debian is probably out of the
question for now.  However, the feedback from such a system would make
it much easier for a Debian user to create packages in their local
repository.  It would also make it easier for Debian Developers (or
Ubuntu or Fedora developers) to look at bigger Java projects with
multiple JARs and decide if they are suitable for official uploads to a
distribution.  It would do some of the leg work for us (stripping out
binary artifacts and building the re-packaged source tarballs that we
need sometimes) and then we would still put in the finishing touches
manually to make a package that is official.
