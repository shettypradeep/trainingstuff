Eclipse can resolve missing dependencies by looking at other projects in 
your workspace.
It is a good idea to turn this off so you don't make projects that only 
work in your workspace.

You can look at project properties to see where Eclipse is getting your 
dependencies
This can help track down the case where it builds in Eclipse or shows no 
errors in the imports while editing but will not build outside Eclipse.
