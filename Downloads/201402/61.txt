The problem appears to be well known but is not something that one 
expects and it will be hard to know where people are most likely to look.

It is not really a Maven problem and as I understand it, if you just set 
your dependencies and build, you will not see the problem or be affected 
by it.
If you are trying to use your own repository's proxy to Maven Central to 
quickly find the latest version rather than visiting the website of the 
developer of the library, you will have trouble.
If you go to directly to searching Maven Central, you will not have the 
problem.

It seems that you need to separate the problem from the point where the 
user will run into it.
The most likely place to look for it is in Maven since that is where one 
might read documentation about setting up dependencies, even if it has 
nothing to do with Maven.

http://maven.apache.org/guides/getting-started/index.html#How_do_I_use_external_dependencies
is probably the most likely place to see a note about browsing Maven 
Central
It  most likely could go somewhere in this paragraph:
<quote>
What about dependencies built somewhere else? How do they get into my 
local repository? Whenever a project references a dependency that isn't 
available in the local repository, Maven will download the dependency 
from a remote repository into the local repository. You probably noticed 
Maven downloading a lot of things when you built your very first project 
(these downloads were dependencies for the various plugins used to build 
the project). By default, the remote repository Maven uses can be found 
(and browsed) athttp://repo.maven.apache.org/maven2/. You can also set 
up your own remote repository (maybe a central repository for your 
company) to use instead of or in addition to the default remote 
repository. For more information on repositories you can refer to 
theIntroduction to Repositories 
<http://maven.apache.org/guides/introduction/introduction-to-repositories.html>.

</quote>

It would still be an odd notation and might still be hard to find, given 
the initial analysis that a new Maven user would have of the apparent 
problem.

I am not sure what the cost of creating a new index is, but perhaps it 
could be done more frequently.

I also do not understand how the index is propagated to my proxy for 
Maven Central in my Nexus repo but I still don't see the latest POI 
either ( my Nexus is very old so perhaps the problem is at my end)
