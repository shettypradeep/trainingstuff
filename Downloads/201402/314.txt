You probably don't want me writing patches!
I could probably drive your car but you would not be very happy if I 
tried to help you by reprogramming your engine control unit to get more 
horsepower.
I person who is using Maven to build tar files and webapps is not 
necessarily the best person to start mucking with internals.

The message could be clearer about what it was complaining about: "Found 
Include in a Dependency Set that is not declared as a dependency"
If the message is triggered by other events, perhaps it might need to be 
a bit more general.

"The following patterns were never triggered in this artifact inclusion filter"

makes one think that the problem has something to do with the flow 
control ("triggered") rather than the artifact itself.
It looks like the message has more to do with the way the plug-in is 
structured internally than the way the configuration is specified.
