mvn release:prepare does a first commit with the POM modified with the
no-SNAPSHOT version, then another commit with the POM modified with the
"next" SNAPSHOT version.
If a build is triggered for the first commit and basically does a "mvn
install" or, worse, a "mvn deploy", then it'll end up deploying your
release version, the very same that "mvn release:perform" will deploy too
(very same version information, not necessarily the same artifact: might
not deploy javadoc and sources for example, or the artifact might be
slightly different because you have plugins in a profile triggered only on,
or never on, release builds).
I think that what Dan referred to as a "CI snapshot build" is the kind of
build triggered by a commit (which generally builds snapshots).
