I don't think that it has anything to do with m2e since the Nexus repo 
has the same problem proxying Maven Central.

It is not a Maven problem but it is most likely that someone will find 
the warning if it is added to the discussion of Maven Central in the 
Maven docs.
It is unlikely that a Maven user would read the FAQ on Maven Central 
since once you set up the link in your Repo or (God forbid in your 
settings.xml), you don't really have any direct contact with Maven Central.

The most likely place that a new person would encounter Maven Central is 
in that section that I referenced in the Maven site.

We have not had this problem but I occasionally use my Nexus repo to 
check for the latest version of a utility rather than look at the 
utility's web site since it is faster when looking up several 
dependencies at once. I have learned something important in this 
discussion!!!
