HI Maxim,

Here is how I do child projects:

    <parent>
        <groupId>com.meterware.totalizer</groupId>
        <artifactId>totalizer</artifactId>
        <version>1.0-SNAPSHOT</version>
        <relativePath>..</relativePath>
    </parent>

    <artifactId>server</artifactId>


Note that I am specifying the parent project, but neither the group nor =
the version for the child project - just the artifactId. The others are =
automatically inherited.

Regards,
Russ
