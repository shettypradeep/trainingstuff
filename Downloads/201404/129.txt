Try using the Eclipse STS from Spring.
It is Eclipse with all the bits and pieces that you need to do Maven and 
most Java development.

This will save a ton of time every time you need to set up a new 
workstation or upgrade an existing one.
You can use the Eclipse preference screens to manage and understand 
where Maven is located and which .m2 folder is the "real" one.

It comes with tools to start a new Maven project with the right 
structure and initial pom files.
