So for anyone else that stumbles across this thread, here's what you need:

PLEASE note - I tend to have singular, non-multi-module maven builds.
One repo per module kinda belief.

1 - The credentials plugin - allows you to let jenkins manage some private =
keys.
2 - The ssh-agent plugin - allows you to let the jenkins process to
have that key in its ssh-agent as the process runs
3 - deployer keys for each github repo you want
-------------------------------
1 - Generate the deployer keys
(https://help.github.com/articles/managing-deploy-keys)
2 - Take the private key and store it in jenkins via the credentials plugin
3 - Any maven release project you want to release back to github, make
sure you specify the credentials in the git config AND turn on
ssh-agent in the build section
