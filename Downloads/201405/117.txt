A solution like this, is what I would like to replace, actually. :-)

What we have, is:
 - A jar that is built with maven, and installed in the local plexus
   archive, this Jar file creates an excel file from a template
 - Many jenkins projects that uses the jar together with two python
   scrips
 - The python scripts, are:
  - A script to delete existing XLS files in the working directory
  - A script to download the jar from plexus

What I would like to have, are maven projects that would:
 1. Have the jar project as a dependency
 2. Run the jar to create the XLS spreadsheet in the target directory
 3. Offer the the XLS spreadsheet in the target directory as a Jenkins
    build artifact

Ie. since the python scripts does things that maven does by default
(clean the working directory, and download jar files from plexus),
replacing them with a maven project seemed like a good idea.
