I'm none to sure that this would even help at all:

Presumably you are trying to separate artifacts used by plugins during 
your build (where you might use e.g. GPL licensed modules) from 
artifacts used as dependencies in your project proper (where using that 
same GPL licensed modules would make your legal department scream) by 
separating the repositories used to provide them.

As far as I know/understand all artifacts are downloaded to the same 
local cache repository (~/.m2/repository), regardless of whether they 
were required by some plugin or as a dependency of your project.

This makes them available for both purposes and thus obliterates all 
your efforts of keeping them separate.

Maven Masters: Please correct me if I'm wrong.

Cheers,
Wolf
