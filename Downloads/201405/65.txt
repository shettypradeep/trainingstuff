Hello, 

i am trying to transfert documentation for an application, which is written using a .odt file, to some doxia process, so i can be sure pdf is the lastest version in the build. 

However, i am facing a surprisingly basic problem: i can't find out how to include an inline image. That is, i can put image before, or after a paragraph, but i can't put it inside a paragraph. I tried xhtml, apt, confluence, twiki, xdoc and markdown. 

Here are my results: 
apt -> there is no way to make an inline image in apt 
confluence -> while the language allows it, and the eclipse confluence parser shows it properly, the image tag is not read by doxia and the wiki code appear as is on the final document. image is properly recognized when inside a paragraph 
twiki -> didn't find a way to make an inline image 
markdown -> image tag is recognized inline, but everything after the tag, in same paragraph, is ignored. 
xhtml -> while verbose, this language does allow inline image. Unfortunately, all inline image are showed above paragraph in the resulting pdf, not inline. 
xdoc -> the parser just doesn't kick in, doxia think it's a docbook and messes everything 

So, my question is simple: how can i put an inline image in a doxia document. Which markup language must i use, and what is the process? 

Best result i got so far was with xhtml, and it looked like this in pdf,

when it should have looked about like this (original open office document):
