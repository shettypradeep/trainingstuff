It is a very specific case, yes. And technically I can change it if I
really need to. It's an open source project which we are trying to avoid
making changes to the upstream version in this particular case, because it
doesn't need to be a jar file for the mainline. We just want to override it
internally. In the end it's probably just going to be a local patch that we
keep on our own branch.

Thanks for the help.
