I got that working.. but I think it would not work with multi-modules?

I have it working in a module=E2=80=A6 but it writes to / =E2=80=A6 I would=
 assume it would
write to /$module_name =E2=80=A6 or something along those lines.

So I think later modules would overwrite previous modules.  But perhaps I=
=E2=80=99m
wrong.
