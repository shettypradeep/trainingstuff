There are commercial solutions (sonatype, contrast, blackduck, palamida,
etc.) and FOSS solutions (dependency-check, victims, retire.js, etc.) to
identify and report on known vulnerabilities. I would recommend looking at
these solutions (note, I am the main contributed to dependency-check).

A better solution for the POM modification would be to add a CPE
identifier. This would also be a great entry for a jar file's manifest. CPE
identifiers can be requested even if there are no known CVEs, but the CPE
can be used to lookup the related CVEs.
