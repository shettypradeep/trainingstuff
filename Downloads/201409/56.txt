Of course one of my long term goals is to teach KK how to use Maven... He
keeps going to maven expecting a fight... And lo he gets one.

I keep trying to unwind his battles but every time I unwind one he's
started two more...

In short, do not use the way Jenkins abuses maven as a way to learn how to
use maven...

(Aside: KK's lack of full gr=C3=B6k of maven explains *why* the jenkins mav=
en
(aka evil) job type is so evil)
