A side note: you can specify version ranges if you want to leave it up 
to Maven to select the latest version.
It makes it harder to have a repeatable build or to determine what 
version was used to build your artifact.

I generally like to pick the versions of dependencies and Eclipse/STS's 
Maven support makes it easy to spot conflicts and exclude transitive 
dependencies that conflict with what you want.


I doubt that adding a section to the POM to record bug fixes would be 
very useful.
No one would keep it up to date and the traffic on the POM source might 
drive a team crazy if they did.
