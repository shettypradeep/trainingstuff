The problem I have here is that this would definitely fix my problem.
 Breaking it out into another OSS project would be sweet=E2=80=A6

BUT=E2=80=A6 it would introduce its own set of problems.

Now I have two projects to maintain.  And the number is increasing=E2=80=A6=
 From an
IDE perspective, I have to have N windows and switch between them, and
remember which file is in which project.

I find it=E2=80=99s 100x easier to just keep everything in one project.

I could use git-submodules=E2=80=A6 but IDEA breaks on them and they have a=
 few
gotchas.

=E2=80=A6 but perhaps there=E2=80=99s no perfect solution.  Just a few solu=
tions that are
less horrible than my current solution.
