FYI my aim is to supersede the evil job type with some enhanced reporting
in what is currently called the literate job type.

That would mean you'd get the per-module reporting.

The current evil job type's other "killer" feature is automatic downstream
job triggering... Which is actually broken as it does not take into account
the local repo that the -SNAPSHOTs may or may not have been deployed into
and assumes that `package` is the same as `deploy` as far as triggering is
concerned as well as ignoring that deployment might be to a staging repo,
so the artifacts may not be available downstream... However, despite being
fundamentally broken at every level, you would be surprised how many people
feel locked into the evil job type because of this...

In short, there is so many issues with it that I cannot recommend its
use... The only semi useful feature from my PoV is per module reporting.

(Sadly my day job has me having to support the evil job type from time to
time... Though usually those tickets get picked up by Kohsuke if I start
another "evil job type" tirade ;-) )
