Hi,

 > we have scm-publish plugin for that

I've already used that for GitHub pages...works like a charm...

https://github.com/khmarbaise/smpp
https://github.com/khmarbaise/uptodate-maven-plugin etc.

which makes it very ease...

apart from that you can use github-site-plugin which works as well...

https://github.com/github/maven-plugins


Kind regards
