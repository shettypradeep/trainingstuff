The loop idea is a good one.. I=E2=80=99d have to implement that on my own =
but it=E2=80=99s
not the end of the world.

And I=E2=80=99d love to live in a world you present above where all test ca=
ses work
and can be isolated :)

=E2=80=A6 but it=E2=80=99s not practical. Google has a big problem with thi=
s in their unit
testing.  They have millions of unit tests and they can=E2=80=99t fail a wh=
ole
build because 1/5000 of their tests are flakey.  At 1M tests you=E2=80=99re=
 going
to end up with a lot failing.

In my situations I have weird race conditions with ActiveMQ having a JMX
bug where there=E2=80=99s a race from the GC time of the queue and the time=
 I read
the JMX value.

I have about 2-3 of these.. I CAN NOT reproduce these at all.. only during
testing. It=E2=80=99s amazingly annoying :-(
