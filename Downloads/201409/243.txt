It is possible.
One way is to use a generic packaging plugin like the
maven-assembly-plugin. If that doesn't fit your desires, or you want a
"nicer solution", writting your own plugin is a different way. For example,
have a look at the Android Maven Plugin which creates android archives.

That being said, the web app you're talking about should be a standard war
projekt (which uses the maven-war-plugin to produce the war archive). The
desktop app could possibly be a standard jar project. So I don't think you
need any special packaging plugins, but your question is rather how to
handle these two flavors of your application. Something that you should try
to solve, as it will significantly simplify things, is to have only one
package/archive. Have a look at how, for example, the Jenkins projekt has
solved this. They produce a war file that is possible to deploy to a web
container (web app) as well as start from command line (application). When
looking at that topic you're in pure Java land and shouldn't worry about
Maven.
If you need different config files it could be tricky to solve this way
though.
