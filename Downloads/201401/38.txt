I disagree (when comparing with Gradle). The differentiator to me is going
beyond the build tool: project management and comprehension tool. Things
like the m-release-p, m-scm-p, m-site-p, etc. No other tool has those
AFAICT, and not everybody wants or needs them.
On the negative side: linear lifecycle, fixed number of classpaths (scopes)
that forces you to use separate modules (not a problem per se) thus put
files in separate folder trees (more of an issue, even if it means losing
IDE support), etc. Many of which contribute to making it really hard to
migrate from Ant to Maven.

"apply plugin: java" is all you need to declare in Gradle ;-)

(OK, you also need a couple other lines to deploy to a Maven or Ivy repo,
but no more than in a POM)
