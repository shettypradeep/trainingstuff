So, I tried my google-fu first - and in general my google-fu is very very s=
trong...

I've been fighting with this multi-module plan for some time now with the d=
eveloper who is reporting the issue to me.  The issue manifested itself as =
part of a Sonar failure...  the funny thing is, that the failure was on a d=
ependenct tree resolution that Sonar was doing - so I had him try the depen=
dency plugin and perform a dependency:tree

dependency tree failed us...  well, it probably isn't dependency plugin's f=
ault but I am at a loss as to what it is really dying on or why.

I would absolutely love it if someone saw this and said "Oh yeah, I know th=
at issue.  Its a real pain.  They have XXX defined incorrectly in their mul=
timodule build so the dependency plugin is in a circular dependency loop" (=
or something like that).  I have no idea if its a dependency loop, was just=
 an example.

I can't share the poms because its all proprietary closed source stuff (and=
 I have to be careful about what is shared).  If this means that I dont hav=
e enough info to help, I can live with that - and will continue to plow for=
wards...  I just wanted to see if theres someone on the list who knows exac=
tly what I should be looking for to help shorten my investigation time.

Here's an example of what dependency:tree is complaining about.
