I think we would have no issue getting a small amount of funding from the
foundation to feed an external logo competition... but I think we would
want to have some scope defined for such a competition... so yeah I see no
issue with using the top 3 as seed for an external logo competition, e.g.
on the site already mentioned on a previous thread... but I think we do
need a spec and part of the point of this discussion is to generate such a
spec.
