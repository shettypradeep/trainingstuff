I don't want a religious war. If Gradle or ANT are a better fit for the way
some people think about building software... well good for them... and the
faster we can help them realise that Maven takes a different tack the
better.

I happen to believe that the power of Maven comes from being model driven
rather than procedural, which ultimately allows for a richer IDE
experience, but consequently you lose some flexibility in your build
process. It is a tradeoff I happen to like the Maven balance of, but I am
not so arrogant to presume that Maven's balance suits everyone.

The Maven repository has grown beyond just Maven, so that is no longer a
key differentiator for Maven.

The differentiator is in the declarative build rather than procedural
build...

With Ant you have a mostly pure procedural build.

With Maven you have a mostly pure declarative build.

With Gradle you have a hodge-podge mix of both.

(By declarative, I mean <packaging>jar</packaging> is all I need to
declare, maven knows how everything fits into that)

So let's let others go to the tools that suit their tastes, and the faster
that we help them there, the less bitching about how "Maven is crap
(because it doesn't suit my taste)" we will hear.

It's like marmite: you either love it or hate it!
