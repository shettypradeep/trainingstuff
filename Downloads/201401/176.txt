Maven is like a village made from tents... you can move from location to
location (project to project) and you bring all the same tents (phases /
conventions as to how to build a project) with you. Because we are an
Apache project we chose a tent that is keeping with the stylings of the
Apache feather logo

There's a post-hoc justification for you ;-)
