*but* if you see a maven build, you know it pretty much has to be
declarative...

if you see a gradle build it can add a whole procedural set of steps quite
trivially on top..

(you can also add procedural stuff to maven, but it is hard and ugly
because of the syntax and the way maven forces you to work)

Basically I view the main "advantage" of gradle as it's main
"disadvantage"... others are free to invert that point of view if/as they
see fit, but I have yet to see the benefits of the flexibility that gradle
adds... I have only seen downsides... I'll not go ramming my PoV down your
mouth... as long as you don't try and ram your PoV down mine ;-)
