Hello again,

OK, I suspected that I get a lot of replies on this :-).=20

=46rom experience in other forums I also expected to have people tell me =
to go screw myself, but that has not happened. There are apparently only =
professionals here! That said, there some very good replies and =
explanations but also some I do react to. =20

I'll start with the latter. The arguments about quality I just don't =
buy. We are only talking poms here. Whatever is in the poms says nothing =
about the quality of the software itself. What is really bothering me =
however is the argument that if you don't have your things in the way we =
think they should be, you are not serious enough. It hasn't been said =
straight out but implied. The word that pops into my head here is =
"Moralizing"! I take my work very seriously and I take my open source =
work even more seriously (since in that case I'm allowed the time for it =
:-)). That if I have one file that is not up to someones liking I'm not =
taking releasing of my software seriously is just absurd.=20
_______

=46rom one of the replies:
> As I said in a previous message, deploying to the remote repo is just =
a
> matter of "mvn deploy", using either the maven-deploy-plugin (by =
default)
> or the nexus-staging-maven-plugin.

That is good, that is how easy it should be!

> You'll have to configure the GPG plugin to sign your artifacts though, =
as
> it's a requirement to deploy to Central.

No problem!

I'm going to go though the documentation again and solve the "easy" way =
to do it :-).  And If I can't find a page that explains this clearly I =
will create such! I have gotten very much information here to go on.=20

Someone also pointed out that local webserver repositories are good =
enough for "small" projects. I basically agree with that. I only =
considered maven central since someone asked me. But it is easier to =
have things in central and not have to add multiple repository =
specifications in your pom/settings. OK, you can use nexus to merge =
several repositories into one and then use that. But if submission to =
central can be made easy then it is worth to do it. Software does not =
have to be large apache projects to be useful. There are some truly =
useful software out there that comes from single individuals.
________

Here is my view of how I would want a maven repository to be:

- No requirements of javadoc or sources. If you want to include those, =
no problem, but if you don't  it is up to you. Personally I like to have =
sources available in the repository for the third party software I'm =
using so I would also submit sources to my software, but that is =
entirely up to me.

- Tags on submitted software (not required - can be empty).=20

- Searchable data in addition to group and artifact:
  - Tags
  - Descriptions

- A browsable (navigable) web gui, not just searches.=20

- A standardized documentation zip containing PDFs and/or markdown.

- Quality indication:
  - The possibility to star artifacts just like you can star repos in =
github. Also for group level.
  - Download statistics (filtered on ip-address, multiple downloads from =
the same ip-address only count as one).
  - A quality value based on these two as sorting order for search =
results.

- When an artifact or group is selected in the web gui the following =
should be displayed:
  - Dependency tags for the artifact (obviously :-))
  - Pom information like description, web url, developers, scm url, etc.
  - Stars and download stats.
  - Any submitted docs.

With so much software available in one place it would be very nice to =
have it more searchable and on more useful criteria, and also to have =
the ability to get more details on the software at the same place.

Tommy
