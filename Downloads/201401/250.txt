I would link it from a FAQ page, not the front page... as understanding our
choice of metrics to compare on requires some understanding of Maven
first... otherwise a comparison that we think is fair to Maven will not be
well understood.

1. Don't preach to the reader... we should not tell them what to think

2. Don't speak ill of others

3. Don't assume that the reader cannot think for themselves.

I am not saying we put the onus on the reader to make the inference. This
could be the very first tool in this space that they have discovered.

We should state our philosophy... give links to explain what we mean in the
description, so that loaded terms can be understood by people who are
unfamiliar with them... and by all means lets give links to

I am saying *no way* will we mention other build tools on the front page or
in the project description.

If we even need a comparison... but a comparison is not needed as much as a
rebrand of the initial RX (or reader experience)

Let's get the content needed to get a reader up and running and doing a few
builds quickly that they can develop a feel for the Maven way... again that
hits the theme of letting the reader find out - as quickly as we can let
them - whether they love maven or hate it.

The first level content should also hit things like the release plugin and
project documentation

The second level content should then be focused on more advanced things...

* deviating from the conventions

* writing simple plugins

* forging a new path for a new packaging type

The third level content, if we get that far, would be the more advanced
plugin writing stuff...

Only when we get that far should we start thinking about comparisons with
other tooling

Why would we want to put a flame war on our site?

I think in the FAQ we could have a "comparison to other tools" section with
things like

Q: "I just want to specify the exact steps that Maven should build, like I
can with Gradle. Why does Maven make this hard to do?"

Q: "I just want to keep my dependencies in source control like Ant lets me.
Why can't Maven use the dependencies that are in source control, forcing me
to run a repository manager just to host them?"

Such content sits best in a FAQ... but we should not knock these other
tools. They are just as valid at building software as Maven is... look at
the end result... the software is built.

>From our philosophy there is a big difference... there is a whole larger
layer of trade-offs that we see... and from our point of view once you see
the bigger picture that we see... well why would you use anything other
than Maven... *but* that does not make us _right_... it just makes us
self-consistent.

We don't know why somebody has landed on our front page... what we want to
do is get the people who don't want to be here to move on as fast as
possible so that they appreciate the fact that we have not wasted their
time.

Maven... you either love it or hate it... I am happy with that
