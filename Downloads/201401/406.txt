Such a comparison should not be on the first page people land on. If we can
come up with a comparison that we think is fair to all, even if comparing
on our best feature set, then that is fine. The point I was making in that
"note" is that excluding mentioning the competition in the project
description does not mean we are excluding mentioning them at all. The
second point is that there is an argument against having such a comparison
chart anyway... but if we have one that we think is fair to all and
reflects our philosophy then that is fine... not priority #1, #2 or #3 for
a re-design of the maven site
