My first draft did not have the graph at the top... perhaps it would be
better suited at the bottom ;-)

I like to think of the project model as not just the root pom.xml but all
the pom.xml files, so there is only one project model, this should make
understanding how -pl, -am and -amd switches have their effects

No there is one and only one build plan. We would have to redefine build
plan everywhere else to be able to use it like that. There is a lifecycle
binding for each packaging

I want the 60sec tutorial to be the grand overview, the next tutorial is a
5 minute one on how a .jar file gets built

Then you have a multi-module webapp tutorial at 10-15min

I want to reference all the core concepts from the 60 second overview even
if only briefly, that way people can come back to the short page and say
"ahh yes that is where that fits in again"
