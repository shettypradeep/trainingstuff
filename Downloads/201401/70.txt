I actually think that the page is near complete from my point of view...
the remaining content is actually to provide links to pages describing what
each individual concept is and a link to the next level of depth tutorial.

I what to draw only the outline of what maven does... on the other hand, if
you can think of an alternative set of content I am only too happy to see
such suggestions. If you need write access to the wiki, shout out and I'll
make it so (assuming you are a regular user/dev list contributor)
