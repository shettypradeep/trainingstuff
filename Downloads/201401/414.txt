I don't really understand what you want to do

see http://svn.apache.org/viewvc/maven/pom/trunk/maven/ for something q=
uite=20
similar
In our case, the change to use src/site-docs instead of src/site is don=
e in a=20
separate site-pom.xml instead of a profile in pom.xml, but it doesn't c=
hange=20
the principle used: configure siteDirectory

What I don't understand is

Such siteDirectory configuration won't affect modules structure

The fact is that configuring siteDirectory not only gives you another s=
ite.xml,=20
but site content (apt, xdoc, fml, md,...) isn't shared: do you want to =
share=20
content between your sites?
That's the only reasong why I would understand your need of a different=
=20
site.xml without changing siteDirectory (which isn't an actually suppor=
ted=20
feature)
