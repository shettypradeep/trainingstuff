I thought release:perform is doing a checkout from the last vcs tag 
which
was created by release:prepare.

Anyways, something is doing a checkout of the latest tag. My test 
resources
are not included in the vcs (as they have credentials). But that's all 
fine
and the way I want it.

I just need a way to copy those unversioned files from
src/test/resources/ to target/checkout/target/test-classes/ before
mvn:release is running test.

They're in src/test/resources/ and everything works as usual. I guess 
those
resources are somewhere in maven's super pom defined.

I'll try that. I forgot that I already posted here and didn't subscribe
so I read today the first time about it.
