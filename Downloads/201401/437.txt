I like Roy Lyons contribution as an opening sentence.
I think that the second and third sentence should be about what Maven is 
not what it is not. If we are going to compare it to Ant or Gradle, it 
should be done in a way that explains what Maven does not what it does 
not do.

"Apache Maven is a convention-over-configuration build tool which has 
great dependency management features.  Maven uses a project object model 
to describe the dependencies and any special processes that are required 
to build the software. This encapsulates all of the knowledge required 
to repeatedly build the software as well as the supporting documentation 
and project reports. This frees the software developer from many of the 
routine tasks associated with software development. Maven enforces a set 
of best practices around version control and the software release 
process which encourages adherence to enterprise and project  standards 
regarding dependent libraries and collaborative development."
