I haven't tried it, but personally I would be shocked if Maven allowed this
at all. Did you try it? Does it work?

IMO, the major reason for versions is so that Maven (and humans) knows to
select one from a set. If you need more than one at the same time, change
the value of A.

Including multiple versions of the same artifact violates Maven's current
assumptions rather severely.

Regards,
Curtis
