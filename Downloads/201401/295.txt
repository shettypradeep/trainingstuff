On the flip side - I would argue that the process is not too
difficult. It is well documented and easy to understand, it can also
be automated if you wish.

You need not necessarily inherit the Sonatype pom, and if you do you
can override whatever you like anyway.

I think the current process means that artifacts that are released are
well thought about and that their pom's provided a minimum of useful
information.

If you want to release something and you care about it, then I will
assume that it is of good quality, then I would ask the question "Why
should you care less about a high quality release than the code?"

is a completely brilliant idea. It takes open source to a new level where a=
nyone can just depend on other open source code and automatically download =
it on build. This is really good for the open source world (well, at least =
the Java/JVM part of it) . The fact that the release process to this centra=
l repository is far too complex, I see as a really great problem, inhibitin=
g the easy sharing of open source work. I have often found open source tool=
s and frameworks that are not available in maven central, and that is becau=
se not everyone is willing to put up with this, which now also includes mys=
elf. As I see it, either this procedure needs to be changed to provide a tr=
ivial release of binary artifacts without affecting your poms, or there nee=
d to be an alternative open repository providing ease of release, where it =
is trivial for anyone to share their binaries for easy access by others. I=
=E2=80=99m wondering if I=E2=80=99m alone in this view or if there are othe=
rs who agree with me ?
