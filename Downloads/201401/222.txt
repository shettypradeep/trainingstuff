Well I have no issue with saying that each packaging has a template for how
when to use plugins during the lifecycle.

But the build plan is the plan of what will be done, and it is a well used
term in Maven.

The lifecycle is also a well used term in Maven.

This is the 20,000ft reference that lets people get to understand what
these terms are... I think it is OK for it to skim over the detail (we can
make the images be links to more detail as people need it), but I don't
believe we do anyone a service by avoiding introducing our core concepts...
especially if these core concepts and their poor understanding are part of
the root for the misuse and misunderstanding of maven by a large body of
people
