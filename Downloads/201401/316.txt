Several sentences sounds good. But here=92s another question. Comparing =
Maven to ant is almost too easy in terms of advantages. Is gradle now a =
serious competitor (I had been working on converting an enormous project =
to maven, but the architect decided to switch to gradle, so I am =
particularly sensitive to the issue). I can see some superficial =
advantages of gradle that might appeal to some projects. Is it better to =
ignore or address this?
