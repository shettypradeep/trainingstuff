Hi Tommy,

Can you give a hint from where this "requirements" are comming from?

I know of the following:

https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository+Usage+Guide

This is what i use...

http://search.maven.org/#artifactdetails%7Ccom.soebes.smpp%7Csmpp%7C0.6.3%7Cpom

I don't have Sontype pom as parent for example....

This is the basic workflow with Maven release plugin.

Sure. During the release workflow a tag is created...

Needed to promote the artifacts to Maven Central..

Do you have something which is not Java/JVM based ? Like 
Ruby/Python/Perl/Whatever ?

The problem in earlier days where that it was too easy to put something 
on Maven central and the results have been:
bad quality, many arfitacts which are not signed,
containing repositories in the pom's which results in many problems and
other problems...

The point in this is: To hold a quality level inside of Maven central.

I think the price it's worth the effort. It's a real centralized area 
where everyone can get the artifacts from. If you use 
Maven/Gradle/BuildR/Ant+IVY/WhatEver etc.

 >  As I see it, either this procedure needs to be changed to provide

What do you mean by "without affecting you poms?" During the release 
process the versions of your artifacts are being changed from 
X.Y-SNAPSHOT to X.Y so the pom's must be changed.

May be i misundestand a thing here...

Don't hesitate to make suggestions how to make it simpler and reliable 
too...

Unfortunately I don't, cause i know the drawbacks of a simpler 
procedure...but i'm willing to learn to get things better...

Kind regards
