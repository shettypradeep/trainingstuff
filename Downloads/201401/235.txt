I uploaded lots of not-even-Mavenized prebuilt JARs to Maven Central and ca=
n tell you that you simply misunderstood these terms as "essential" require=
ments -- in fact most of them are only "best practices". You do neither nee=
d to have the Sonatype POM, it will just make things easier, nor do you hav=
e to use SNAPSHOTs. You can simply upload a prebuilt JAR file. The only "ha=
rd" requirements are a "good" POM, signing the JAR with GPG, uploading it t=
o the OSS nexus instance, then closing and releasing it. This it at-most si=
mple and done in minutes. If you need help, feel free to contact me at mark=
us@headcrashing.eu, I can guide you.

Subject: Maven Central Opinion

I was asked to submit one of my opensource tools at github to maven central=
. This turned out to be a rather complex procedure.

Sonatype puts the following requirements on anyone wanting to submit to mav=
en central:

- You are forced to set a Sonatype pom as parent of your project and thus i=
nherit things you have no control over.=20
- You are forced to have a SNAPSHOT version even if you have no use for suc=
h.
- You are forced at submission time to select a new version for your softwa=
re even if you have no idea if it will be a minor, bugfix or new functional=
ity at this point in time.=20
- Your public repository (github, etc) which you are forced to point out in=
 your pom are no longer yours to decide over. It will be updated during the=
 submission process.=20
- After running 3 different mvn commands you also need to login to Sonatype=
s nexus server and "release" the artifacts before the become available.=20

The idea of the maven repository that has grown larger than maven itself is=
 a completely brilliant idea. It takes open source to a new level where any=
one can just depend on other open source code and automatically download it=
 on build. This is really good for the open source world (well, at least th=
e Java/JVM part of it) . The fact that the release process to this central =
repository is far too complex, I see as a really great problem, inhibiting =
the easy sharing of open source work. I have often found open source tools =
and frameworks that are not available in maven central, and that is because=
 not everyone is willing to put up with this, which now also includes mysel=
f. As I see it, either this procedure needs to be changed to provide a triv=
ial release of binary artifacts without affecting your poms, or there need =
to be an alternative open repository providing ease of release, where it is=
 trivial for anyone to share their binaries for easy access by others. I'm =
wondering if I'm alone in this view or if there are others who agree with m=
e ?=20
