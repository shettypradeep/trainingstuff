Perhaps I just wasn't clear enough...

Maven will resolve any list of dependencies so that there is a single
unique version of any GA.

Where you have a maven does not bomb out when you double list a dependency,
you will get a single version.

The correct parsing behaviour that Maven *should* follow is:

* If the double dependency is in a project *being built* then fail the build

* If the double dependency is in a dependency of the project being built,
then resolve to single version.

AFAIK the only unknown I am aware of is whether the first case applies, but
in all cases that I am aware of you will only see one version of any GA
