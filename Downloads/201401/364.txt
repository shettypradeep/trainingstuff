Hi Tommy,

I did not notice any other reply specifically troubleshooting this problem,
so... my guess is that you have a SNAPSHOT dependency in your dependency
hierarchy. You cannot cut a release unless it only depends on releases.
Otherwise, the behavior of the release could change out from under you
if/when that SNAPSHOT version is updated.

If you share the exact error message you received, others can assist in
more detail.

Regards,
Curtis
