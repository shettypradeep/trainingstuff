Yes.
I think that I was agreeing with that sentiment.

I still think that a product comparison page/chart is a useful way to 
help a reader understand whether maven is a good choice in their 
circumstance.
It should be on a separate page but could be linked from the front page.

Good start on a second paragraph for the opening page.
It explains why Maven was built the way it was.
One has to read between the lines to understand the "what's in it for 
me" but does hint at simplifying the build instructions through taking 
advantage of common patterns based on the output to be created.
Perhaps if we focus on the benefits to this approach, we could add some 
framing around what you wrote to come up with a solid second paragraph.

Could be incorporated into the text above.
I am not sure that I would put the onus on the user to make the inference.
We should just state the benefits - simplification, standardization, 
adherence to corporate/enterprise best practices - and how Maven/"Maven 
way" achieves these (by taking advantage of commonality of build flow, 
etc. as you stated above).

I am not sure that I would mention the other build tools specifically here.
I would save it for the comparison.

I see this discussion as part of a flame war that can be buried deeper 
in the site.
I think that we should assume that a person who is arriving on the front 
page is coming looking for a solution not a range war.
If they decide to use Ant, so be it.
