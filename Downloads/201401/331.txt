> Several sentences sounds good. But here’s another question. Comparing Maven to ant is almost too easy in terms of advantages. Is gradle now a serious competitor (I had been working on converting an enormous project to maven, but the architect decided to switch to gradle, so I am particularly sensitive to the issue). I can see some superficial advantages of gradle that might appeal to some projects. Is it better to ignore or address this?

The more that can be said to relate Maven to what the reader already 
knows or is considering, the more useful the paragraph.
There is no reason why the following paragraphs could not point deeper 
into the documentation for comparisons with Ant or Gradle.
I would suggest that the first paragraph not include links so that the 
reader can at least get through one clear section before starting to 
jump around and get carried off into the world of hyperlinks.
