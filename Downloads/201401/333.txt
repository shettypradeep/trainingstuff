I am assuming that you are putting this in Central so I can easily use 
it without having to worry about the effect on my build process or 
without having to get into your sources and dependencies to build my app 
and I have appropriate license agreements included so I know what I am 
incorporating into my app.

In that case, I would like you to follow the Maven "Best Practices" for 
deploying to Central.

Using the Release plug-in may save you some steps if you do not already 
have a private repo for releasing software internally.
It seems to me that if you are already "releasing" to your own repo 
prior to trying to upload it to Central, you are probably going to find 
that the Release plug-in is not the "best practice".
We would be in the same situation if we ever decided to put some of our 
utilities into Maven Central. We have already done the release and our 
SCM is in the state in which we want it.
We would probably have to look at our parent POM/child POM structure to 
be sure that it met Maven Central requirements.

I think that you did the right thing by raising your concerns here and I 
think that you got some very good advice and concrete suggestions.

This is a very good group that is usually well-mannered when approached 
in the way that you did.
You were very clear about what you wanted to do and you raised very 
specified issues that you wanted to discuss.
You also reacted to the advice in a positive way that encouraged a 
factual discussion rather than a personal attack.

What is really bothering me however is the argument that if you don't have your things in the way we think they should be, you are not serious enough. It hasn't been said straight out but implied. The word that pops into my head here is "Moralizing"! I take my work very seriously and I take my open source work even more seriously (since in that case I'm allowed the time for it :-)). That if I have one file that is not up to someones liking I'm not taking releasing of my software seriously is just absurd.

But it is easier to have things in central and not have to add multiple repository specifications in your pom/settings. OK, you can use nexus to merge several repositories into one and then use that. But if submission to central can be made easy then it is worth to do it. Software does not have to be large apache projects to be useful. There are some truly useful software out there that comes from single individuals.
