I agree. No product comparison on the first page.

If one is written, it should be accurate and fair but, of course, it 
will focus on things that the Maven community values and that reflect 
the most common development practices as the community sees them.

It should be written in such a way that people who should use Ant will 
understand why Maven is not the right choice and people who should use 
Gradle will understand what they are gaining and what they are losing. 
(Marmite haters should be allowed to go in peace with our blessing)
It should not be written in a way that starts a flame war or is 
unhelpful to the developer who reads it.
