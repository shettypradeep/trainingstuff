Well, I guess I have my answer, I am alone :-).

Many people are telling me that both the sonatype super pom and =
SNAPSHOTs are optional. I obviously have been reading the wrong =
instructions. This is the instructions I've followed:=20

	=
https://docs.sonatype.org/display/Repository/Sonatype+OSS+Maven+Repository=
+Usage+Guide

Are there better, clearer instructions somewhere else ? One of the "mvn =
release:*" commands (dont rember which ) failed if I did not have a =
SNAPSHOT version and told me the problem was that I did not have a =
SNAPSHOT version. So is the above page completely wrong ? Are there =
other "mvn release:*" goals to run ?=20

I also don't buy the argument that release complexity gives better =
quality.=20

Many of the responses to my mail have also indicated that the update of =
my github repository is a totally obvious thing. I simply do not accept =
that. When I update my repository and what I update it with is my and =
only my decision! I went around this problem by making a copy repository =
before going through the release steps, and then deleted the copy =
afterwards, keeping my original intact. It was already in the state I =
wanted it before releasing to maven central. The only thing I want to =
release to maven central is binaries! My repository should not be =
touched. So if there is no way around that happening I guess I have =
released my first and last code to maven central.

Anyhow, my question have been answered very clearly.

> The idea of the maven repository that has grown larger than maven =
itself is a completely brilliant idea. It takes open source to a new =
level where anyone can just depend on other open source code and =
automatically download it on build. This is really good for the open =
source world (well, at least the Java/JVM part of it) . The fact that =
the release process to this central repository is far too complex, I see =
as a really great problem, inhibiting the easy sharing of open source =
work. I have often found open source tools and frameworks that are not =
available in maven central, and that is because not everyone is willing =
to put up with this, which now also includes myself. As I see it, either =
this procedure needs to be changed to provide a trivial release of =
binary artifacts without affecting your poms, or there need to be an =
alternative open repository providing ease of release, where it is =
trivial for anyone to share their binaries for easy access by others. =
I'm wondering if I'm alone in this view or if there are others who agree =
with me ?=20
