Bintray seems quite interesting. I signed up directly! I see that it is =
still a beta and there are some bugs, and a bit of confusion signing up. =
It refused to work signing up with my google account, but after signing =
upp directly I can stil login with my google account.=20

That you can synchronize with GitHub is really nice! That you are =
looking wider than just maven is also really nice. I hope it comes out =
of beta soon! I apparently did not think far enough in my repository =
"wish" :-).
