Read section 7b of the page you link, it addresses your desires
directly. I quote:

You don't have to go through steps 7.a.1. through 7.a.3. if your
artifacts have already been released or if you've generated your
artifacts using something other than Maven.  The steps below allow you
to skip using the maven-release-plugin entirely.  You can either use
the maven-gpg-plugin to sign and deploy your artifacts or upload a
staging bundle.

 can tell you that you simply misunderstood these terms as "essential" requ=
irements -- in fact most of them are only "best practices". You do neither =
need to have the Sonatype POM, it will just make things easier, nor do you =
have to use SNAPSHOTs. You can simply upload a prebuilt JAR file. The only =
"hard" requirements are a "good" POM, signing the JAR with GPG, uploading i=
t to the OSS nexus instance, then closing and releasing it. This it at-most=
 simple and done in minutes. If you need help, feel free to contact me at m=
arkus@headcrashing.eu, I can guide you.

 the Java/JVM part of it) . The fact that the release process to this centr=
