Hi,

As some may know, a lot of work has been done at tesla.io on various =
advanced features in Maven but, unfortunately, not enough work for these =
features to see the light of day. It wouldn't be surprising if Maven =
users have no idea what these features are because I've not done a great =
job at communicating about the work. Some of the work is mine, some of =
other major contributors, and more recently from key customers.

To make a long story short there's a lot of cool stuff to talk about, =
and the work as a new venue at takari.io! I'll be giving a webinar next =
week and here are some of the features I'd like to talk about:

- Polyglot support: Ruby, Groovy, and Scala DSLs. These have all been =
actively worked on in the recent past, especially the Ruby and Scala =
DSLs.
- Full incremental support: the complete Maven lifecycle including an =
incremental command line compiler based on JDT, all with m2e integration
- Aggressive parallelization: a new parallelization mode that also =
optimizes scheduling based on critical path analysis
- Generations: a new form of continuous delivery for Maven -- Smart =
delta protocol and no more SNAPHOTs!
- Shell: long-lived CLI process for Maven

Much of this work is functional, and the new parallelization mode and =
generations support are actively being used in production. We are still =
iterating on these specific features but they show a lot of promise. =
Where all of this code eventually lands is a question for the Maven =
development community. All of this work was developed outside of Apache, =
and how easy it is to integrate back into the Maven project remains to =
be seen. At the very least there is a lot of very interesting work and I =
wanted to start the dialog because Maven just isn't going to die :-)

So please join us for a webinar, Tuesday, January 21 at 11:30AM EST (UTC =
-5 hours) to learn more about what we're working on and what we're =
trying to accomplish.

All registrants will receive access to the recording, so if you can=92t =
make it =97 you won=92t have to miss out.

Hope you can make it,
