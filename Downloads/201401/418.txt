I agree with Robert's comment.
There is a danger that the page will become architecturally elegant and 
will correctly describe all of the possible uses of Maven but will be 
too obscure to be useful as a starting point for a new person.

It is sufficiently difficult to understand the basic concepts in using 
Maven to create a simple jar with a single POM.
You are introducing a lot of new concepts:
-Lifecycle
-Dependencies
-Plug-ins
- Project model
that a person coming from make or Ant has to grasp.

Defining these and the relationships among them in a simple way is 
sufficiently challenging without trying to abstract a sufficiently 
general model to handle all of the edge cases.

The "Maven way" needs to be explained very simply rather than 
conceptually complete.
