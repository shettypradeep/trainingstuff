Subject: Re: New logo?

I asked my wife on the drive to the train today what animal she thinks fits=
 Maven.  Her response made me chuckle.

Without hesitation, she said "Honey Badger"

When I asked why, she said that Honey Badgers are part of nature and genera=
lly do their thing nicely -- but if you piss it off, things will get really=
 really bad...  She said she had the same experience with Maven.  It works =
nicely, but if you try to do something really non-standard, you will feel i=
ts wrath :)

Heh.

Anyhow, I thought it was funny enough to share - not really a serious consi=
deration to make a Honey Badger our mascot.
