It would be great to get the commons compress part into...cause it's 
better maintained etc.

Furthermore it would be a path to get rid of plexus-archiver at all...If 
i understand you would change the plexus-archiver to use 
commons-compress...so after that we could change the other plugins / 
components to use commons-compress directly...

Yes it is....

Of course it needs testing but if we don't go that way we have to stuck 
all the time plexus-archiver ....
