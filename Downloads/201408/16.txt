The reason I ask about calling it from the main pom.xml is because I don't
quite understand how I can put all this in the maven lifecycle.
If I would configure the javadoc plugin as in
http://maven.apache.org/plugins/maven-javadoc-plugin/examples/aggregate.htm=
l
in a separate pom-javadoc.xml and execute it as a separate action, then it
would process and compile those modules two times, right?
So what I probably need is do the lifecycle in the main pom.xml, but after
the compile phase call a separate pom to generate only the javadoc.
But I have no idea how to do this.
Or maybe there is an easier way, but I don't see it.

Another question is why the dependencySourceIncludes or
dependencySourceExcludes isn't actually working.
