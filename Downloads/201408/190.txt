For now, I have solved our problem of duplicate phase execution by
commenting-out the reporting
stanza's of our pom file.

Everything we need is produced by goals other than 'site' - except
findbugs. For that, we are now
making an explicit call to 'findbugs:check' (bound to 'verify') which
doesn't seem to have
the 'forked-duplication' problem.

All of our reports are being generated post-build by Jenkins, so everything
is working.

Thanks,

Mike
