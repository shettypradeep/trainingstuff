Hi,

the only workaround I can think of is specifying the developerConnection  
in this project as well.
The root cause of appending the artifactId to the inherited connection is  
in Maven Core, where as it should actually be SCM independent. That's a  
huge change with a huge impact. It requires a lot plugins to be prepared  
for that.
So as said: always specify the developerConnection in you release root  
project.

thanks,
Robert
