Hello,

instead of requiring everybody to come up with a CPE and add it to the POM,
I would prefer if Maven Central publishes an approved (and registered)
naming scheme to form CPEs which point to well known maven artifacts.

cpe:/a:org.maven.central:groupid,artifactid[,classifier]:version
(or similiar, maybe ask the CPE team about it. alternative would be to have
a common maven-style repo vendor and include the repoid in the "product")

This would allow incidents and CVEs to unambigously refer to libraries and
other artifacts.

The Java eco system is really missing good reports based on open source
components. If you are lucky you find an alert based on a product and can
guess what underlying open source component was vulnerable. This makes (as
you know) the life of a scanner pretty hard.

Gruss
Bernd
