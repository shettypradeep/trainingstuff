It is really a human engineering problem:
1) Whoever breaks the build buys the first round of beer or has to buy 
pizza for the team on Friday. Works for a small team that socializes 
together.
2) Build Breaker of the month club. Post the picture of the last person 
to break the build. If it is a widespread problem, offer reward each 
quarter to people who do not break the build - day-off, lunch with the 
boss at a good restaurant. Keep a scorecard of who is out and who is 
still in the running.
3)Track build breaking as a performance indicator when doing assessments.
4) If a person consistently (you can define this) breaks the build, take 
away their deploy rights so that they have to find someone to deploy 
their stuff and they will have to prove to that person that it has been 
tested. Hurts the pride.
If no one will deploy their stuff, fire them. The team has lost 
confidence in their ability to do the work.
Or just assign them work that does not affect the build - test data 
creation, testing UI, etc.


Or move to Nexus-Pro.
