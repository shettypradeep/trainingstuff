Play *very* firmly wants you to use the activator framework to control your
build and deploy - I'd seriously not try and fight against it.  It's one of
the reasons we dropped the Play framework for a community project we're
working on, that and the constant breaking of APIs etc :-).

Cheers,
Martijn
