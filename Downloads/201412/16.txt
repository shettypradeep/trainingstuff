At this point we have:

A with 2x1st pref, 1x2nd pref (or 3 any pref votes)
B with 5x1st pref, 1x2nd pref (or 6 any pref votes)
H with 10x1st pref, 2x2nd pref (or 12 any pref votes)
K with 4x1st pref, 5x2nd pref, 1x3rd pref (or 10 any pref votes)

The lowest by any measure is A, so I will eliminate A and proceed to
produce a count
