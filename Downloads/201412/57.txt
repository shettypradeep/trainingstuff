Hi to all,

for you information about ApacheCON 2015...Travel Assistance Applications...

Hi pmcs@,

The Travel Assistance Committee (TAC) are pleased to announce that
travel assistance applications for ApacheCon North America 2015 are now
open! This announcement serves as a purpose for you (pmcs@) to let
members of your community know about both ApacheConNA 2015 and about the
TAC assistance to attend. Could you please forward this announcement to
your community, along if possible with information on how your project
is involved in ApacheCon this year?

We'll be holding ApacheCon North America 2015 in populous Austin, TX
April 13 - 17, 2015.

TAC exists to help those that would like to attend ApacheCon events, but
are unable to do so for financial reasons. For more info on this years
applications and qualifying criteria please visit the TAC website at <
http://www.apache.org/travel/ >.  Applications are already open, so
don't delay!

*Important dates*...

   * Sunday 1th February2015 - CFP closes
   * Friday 6th February 2015 - TAC Applications close

Applicants have until the the closing date above to submit their
applications (which should contain as much supporting material as
required to efficiently and accurately process your request), this will
enable TAC to announce successful awards shortly afterwards.

As usual TAC expects to deal with a range of applications from a diverse
range of backgrounds. We therefore encourage (as always) anyone thinking
about sending in an application to do so ASAP.

We look forward to greeting everyone in Austin, Texas in April.

Kind Regards

jan i

(On behalf of the Travel Assistance Committee)




Kind regards
Karl Heinz Marbaise
