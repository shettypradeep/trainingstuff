I sure hope things have changed with all the documentation and help we put into the central landing website and the free staging training course and examples that cover staging to Nexus (and therefore OSSRH and Central) with all sorts of tools. 

http://central.sonatype.org/
http://books.sonatype.com/nexus-book/reference/staging.html
https://github.com/sonatype/nexus-book-examples
http://www.sonatype.org/nexus/members-only/video-gallery-2/free-training/

If not.. let me know!
