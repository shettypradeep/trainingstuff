I'm interested to understand the problem and try to improve.
What is the Maven plugin you're using for wsimport, with which version?=


The general solution to such problem is to use Toolchains: toolchains s=
upport=20
has to be implemented in the plugin.
Here is a list of know plugins supporting toolchains:
http://maven.apache.org/guides/mini/guide-using-toolchains.html

Adding jax-ws plugin to the list would be an interesting improvement

+1 peace: just let everyone choose the best tool for his own use case

And let us know when Maven can be improved.
