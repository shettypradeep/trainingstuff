Hello everyone,

I wanted to ask what you guys though about using maven as an integration 
tool. Is it out of the scope of maven? is anyone else doing this? What I 
mean by integration is that the artifacts are built (also by maven but in 
other jobs) and deployed to nexus, but I still need to download them all 
to a server for deployment. 
The build of this server invokes maven and I hooked to it via a pom that 
points to some artifacts that serve as an entry point to the dependency 
graph and then use the dependency:copy-dependencies goal. The point of 
this was to leverage the dependency information available in poms so I 
didn't have to keep a list of ALL the artifacts needed (osgi bundles BTW), 
just of an entry point for maven to crawl the graph and pull everything. 
The problem I'm encountering that tells me maybe Maven is not meant for 
this is that I need to pull two artifacts where only the version is 
different (since in OSGi both can coexist just fine) but maven chooses 
only one and the other one doesn't get integrated. So, are there ways to 
force maven to not drop the second version when resolving its model or am 
I just stretching what maven can do? if so, are there any other tools that 
leverage pom information to download artifacts from a maven repo? i don't 
want to have to maintain that dependency information in two different 
places

Thank you,
