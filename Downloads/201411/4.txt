Since you are not getting any responses, let me ask some questions to 
get some more details on the table.

1) Where is the definitive single source of dependency info that you use 
to create the GAV ids for Nexus? How can a single pom reference 2 
versions of an artifact?

2) Are you aware of the API for Nexus? Can you use this to get the 
artifacts once you have the list of artifacts?

Perhaps these answers will stimulate some ideas.
