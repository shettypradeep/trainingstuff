I don't know if I can create such a project. I'll try and start with a
simple project as described in my original post. We'll see if this
suffices...

I just checked and I do have most of the dependencies listed in the EAR
but some are missing. I'll fix this and see if this changes anything.

Sorry, I don't get you. I want JARs *to be* in the EAR and no to "not be
in the EAR".

Well, the actual project has more than 150 modules without the
dependencies. I don't think posting the whole pom makes sense. I'll try
to create a sample project instead (could take me some time). If you just
want some m-ear-p configuration or the like, just let me know. I could of
course post this.

As changing the version of the m-ear-p is enough to fix the problem I
really do think it's a bug in the ear plugin.

But the bug only triggers in situations that depend on the infrastructure.

Does this make more sens to you?
