See if we call him shotgun owl I'll have to draw a shotgun so that we can
use him for threats...

"I see you are not following the Maven way... be careful, or Shotgun Owl
will be after you"

;-)

OTOH if people really object to Couch=C3=A9-Tard we can just call him
"Sleeps-Late" instead... but I am sure there is probably an insult in some
language or other if we go with "Sleeps-Late"!

Note: I am not sure my [skills of an artist][1] are up to drawing a shotgun=
.
