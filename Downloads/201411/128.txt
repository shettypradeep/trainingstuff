It sounds like your preparationGoals are not mimicing a full release...
Very often people set them up that way because they are willing to trade
off a failed perform against a faster prepare.

Typically if you are doing the trade-off you go all the way and make
preparationGoals be `initialize`... Sure version numbers are free don't you
know

Again I wonder have you (or somebody else) tweaked the defaults

Or by prepare before it starts the build... I think that should be a valid
complaint
