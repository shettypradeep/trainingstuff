Hi Ron,
#1. I don't understand your question. You mean the poms of the artifacts 
deployed in nexus? they each have their own pom and instructions on how to 
build itself, just like a regular maven artifact
So I have an artifact A that gets deployed to nexus with groupId foo.bar 
and artifactId A and version 1.0 and then six months later A gets updated 
to version 2.0
All this has nothing to do with integration

Now the integration job will say, bring all the artifacts and their 
dependencies to be able to run. One of them will be A 1.0.
Once a 2.0 is released, i don't want to integrate ONLY 2.0. I want to 
integrate 1.0 and 2.0. So in my integration pom i have two dependencies, 
one foo.bar:A:1.0 and another dependency foo.bar:A:2.0. This is were maven 
core complains and ends up resolving one over the other, hence when i do a 
copy-dependencies it only ends up integrating one of them

#2. Yes, I am. The problem is that via the nexus API there's no way to 
have a list of ONLY entry points where i can say explicitly in a list 
(that i'm trying to keep as small as possible) integrate A and that would 
imply B and C if A depends on B and C. When I do it with maven, in my 
integration pom I only declare a dependency on A and the dependency plugin 
will copy transitive dependencies. This allows me to keep the manually 
maintained list as small as possible and never forgetting to update it 
when i introduce new dependencies since those new dependencies will be 
pulled by the dependency plugin just because the POM already contains the 
relationship information

I hope everything is clearer now, let me know

Thanks for replying

Since you are not getting any responses, let me ask some questions to 
get some more details on the table.

1) Where is the definitive single source of dependency info that you use 
to create the GAV ids for Nexus? How can a single pom reference 2 
versions of an artifact?

2) Are you aware of the API for Nexus? Can you use this to get the 
artifacts once you have the list of artifacts?

Perhaps these answers will stimulate some ideas.
Ron
