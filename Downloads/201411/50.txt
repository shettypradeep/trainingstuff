> Background
> =========
>
> I think everyone can agree that the site needs a reorganisation and a
> rewrite. Users cannot find what they need, and the end result is that
> people keep on abusing maven rather than having maven help them.
>
> Try as I might, I have been unable to motivate myself to do the
> reorganisation with the current dated look and feel of the site... I am not
> saying that picking a new logo and selecting a mascot will result in making
> progress, but it can't hurt and I believe it will help
>
> Proposed changes
> ===============
>
> 1. Change the logo font to Alte Haas Grotesk Bold with italics applied by
> Inkscape
> 2. Change the highlighted letter from 'a' to 'v' and replace the v with two
> Apache Feathers
> 3. Adopt the (currently unnamed) owl as our mascot
>
> Here is a link to the font:
>
> http://www.dafont.com/alte-haas-grotesk.font
>
> Here is a large version of the owl and the logo:
>
>
> http://people.apache.org/~stephenc/maven-logo-contest/maven-owl-final-large.png
>
> A regular version of the own and the logo, e.g. a size suitable for use in
> the top of the standard maven sites:

> http://people.apache.org/~stephenc/maven-logo-contest/maven-owl-final.png

> (Note that in all likelihood, the mascot would probably end up on the other

> Logo Rational
> ===========
>
> If we do some searches for the Maven logo:
>
>
> https://www.google.com/search?site=imghp&tbm=isch&q=maven+logo&oq=maven+logo
>
>
> http://www.bing.com/images/search?q=maven+logo&go=Submit&qs=n&form=QBLH&scope=images&pq=maven+logo
>
> Our current logo, with a single highlighted letter stands out quite well
> from the other "maven" logos, so keeping a highlighted letter and an italic
> rendered font maintains continuity with our current logo.
>
> By changing the highlighted letter to the `v` and by using two Apache
> feathers to create the `v`, we connect our logo back to Apache... we are
> Apache Maven after all.
>
> The `v` is also the common short term for version (e.g.v3 is short for
> version 3). Apache Maven puts a lot of emphasis on versions of dependencies
> and plugins... you could say that versions are very important to Maven.
>
> The colours of the feather were changed to solid colours to match the owl
> mascot's scarf, beak and eyebrows
>
> Voting rules
> =========

> Anyone who is subscribed to the dev or users list is eligible to vote.
>
> If you vote multiple times, only your final vote will be counted.
>
> The vote will be open until 1:00pm GMT on Wed 3rd Dec 2014
>
> The vote is for all three changes as one single change. Partial votes (e.g.
> for the logo but not the mascot, or vice-versa) will not be counted.
>
> I, as the caller of the vote, reserve the right to cancel the vote if this
> vote is putting the harmony of the community at risk.

> If a majority of the PMC believe that this vote is putting the harmony of

>
> The decision will be a simple majority, there will be no special veto
> powers.

> +1: [ ] Change the logo to the proposed logo and adopt the owl as project

> -1: [ ] No change
