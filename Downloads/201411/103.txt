I gather that the assumption is that 9.2.20 would include all of the 
security patches of 9.1.20 and that one would never issue a 9.2.19 after 
9.1.20 had been released and that security bugs would always be released 
on the higher versions first.
A release pattern of 9.1.19, 9.2.19 and 9.2.20 followed by a backporting 
to 9.1.20 would be expected rather than
9.1.19, 9.2.19, 9.1.20 followed by 9.2.20.

However, the second release pattern might come about if the 9.2.19 
release is not widely adopted and there is a lot of interest in fixing 
the security problem in 9.1.19 since it is in more production 
environments or in the environment of the person doing the patching.

Version numbers in and of themselves do not guarantee security but at 
least you can easily see that a 9.2.21 release has at least some 
security flaw fixed that 9.2.20 did not but it does not have any added 
functionality.

It also makes it easier to discuss security.
9.x.20 includes fixes security issues 6789,6897, 6899
9.x.21 includes fixes for security issues 6931,6944

If the security patches are backported, one could easily see that 9.1.21 
and 9.2.21 have the same security patches applied (unless some only 
apply to new features in 9.2.20 that do not cause a security problem in 
9.1.20).
If none of the security patches in 9.2.21 apply to 9.1.20, does one 
still issue a 9.1.21 just to signal that it is just as secure as 9.2.21 
even though none of the x.x.21 patches were applied?

When security patches apply to different major versions, one has to do a 
bit of reading to find out that 8.3.35 (actually 8.x.35) has the same 
security patches (at least the ones that apply) as 9.2.21(9.x.21). 
Security release 34 in release 8.x.34 is not as secure as 21 in 9.x.21 
but 9.x.21 is just as secure as 8.x.35.
