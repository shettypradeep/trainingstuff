Stephen,

thanks for these hints, I sometimes used -DperformRelease=true validate as
prepGoal and as git does not force you to push tags and is able to clone
from the local repository as well, your way is much safer. However with svn
removing/readding/recommitting etc. is painful and always leads to problems.

Regards
Mirko
