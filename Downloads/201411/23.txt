Hi,

Thanks for sharing your experiences!
I will have a look at the links you guys sent me. After learning about
Swagger, I have come across:
https://github.com/kongchen/swagger-maven-plugin

RAML looks promising, but I don't think there's a Maven plugin for that.

Once again, thanks for your comments!

Kind regards,

Martin
