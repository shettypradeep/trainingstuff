Please be aware, changing the code of a released library (not SNAPSHOT) =
is not allowed and maven can not take any responsibility for any errors =
this will cause.
Thats why nexus/artifactory do not allow to change the artifact of a =
released version once its uploaded.=20
Only SNAPSHOT versions are allowed to be changed.
