I am a long time user of Swagger and am fairly happy with it.

I immediately ruled out API Blueprints because there's no Java =
implementation. I use Ruby everyday (almost) but I still find using Java =
and Ruby together sometimes difficult even with the presence of JRuby.

RAML popped up a while ago and formed a working group and this spurred =
some activity on the Swagger side, they are both funded efforts.

Swagger has some interesting associated tools, the only drawback for me =
personally is much of this is written in Scala. I'm indifferent to =
Scala, if people are productive with it that's great, but I don't want =
to learn another Java-like language to use/extend a tool. The area where =
this affected me is that I wanted to dynamically generate the Swagger =
documents from JAXRS annotations at runtime but this means you have to =
include the Scala runtime which was a showstopper for my project. But to =
use the Javascript console you only need to produce the documents. You =
can use the use the swagger doclet[1] to produce the document from JAXRS =
annotation, create the document manually, or use whatever other means. I =
just wrote a small tool to scan the annotations and produce the =
document. But once you have the document the console[2] is great and you =
can use all the nifty client generators which are very handy. Once the =
console is working the Javascript client is generated on the fly. The =
Javascript console is a straight forward Backbone application so it's =
fairly easy to augment/extend.

The RAML tools look great and I have a lot of respect for the guys at =
MuleSoft but just haven't had time to play with it.

People develop abstractions by generalizing from concrete examples.
Every attempt to determine the correct abstraction on paper without
actually developing a running system is doomed to failure. No one
is that smart. A framework is a resuable design, so you develop it by
looking at the things it is supposed to be a design of. The more =
examples
you look at, the more general your framework will be.
