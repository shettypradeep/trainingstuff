"Apache Policy is that if it didn't happen on the mailing list, it didn't
happen."

This policy is more important for the dev list where the mailing list is 
an integral part of the decision making process and is the official 
record of the project.

For user's, it is not so important.
I currently subscribe here and am one of the 2800 on LinkedIn.
This is a more active place but LinkedIn is going to grow simply because 
LinkedIn is already a large group and is part of a larger community with 
300 million members.

It may be a while before the quality of discussion on LinkedIn matches 
this mailing list but I would be opposed to supporting any other forum 
since 1 mailing list and 1 forum is enough.

There is no need to pull scarce resources from Apache to build something 
from scratch that competes with a Maven group that has 2800 members already.
