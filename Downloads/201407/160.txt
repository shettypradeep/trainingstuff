Container?  Guess I need to supply more details.
This is a standalone J2SE app.  The server side is legacy.  There is no 
container.  it isn't a web app.

Instead it's run as a jar with the classpath generated from maven's 
dependency set and listed in the jar's manifest.  Maven generates the 
manifest.  The easiest way to accomplish this would be if I could get 
these jars into the nexus repository named as IBM named them.  Then I 
can get them to a single directory so that the IBM trace facility can 
find them.
