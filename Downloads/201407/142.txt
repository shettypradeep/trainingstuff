I belong to both the LinkedIn forum and this one.
This is the most active but on LinkedIn they are not discussing whether 
to have a forum or not so that cuts out a lot of the traffic.

LinkedIn does not send me a copy of each of my postings and does not 
send me duplicate e-mails if someone replies to my posting so that 
reduces the e-mail traffic a bit.

This list is a bit more focused on technical issues and the quality of 
the help available here could not be better.
