What's the default value for the scope? "compile"? Then you can do all you=
=0A=
need with properties. You might use a profile, but it is not necessary:=0A=
=0A=
Declare your dependencies just like before (either in depMgmt or directly):=
=0A=
=0A=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=0A=
=0A=
Then you can simply redefine "flexmojo.scope" from command line. This will=
=0A=
also affect inherited dependencies, if they are declared in the same way in=
=0A=
the repository or if you delcare them in a common parent with a=0A=
dependencyManagement section. You might even overwrite the property in a=0A=
profile:=0A=
=0A=
=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D %< =3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=

=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=3D=0A=
=0A=
Unfortunately, I don't know nothing about flexmojo. If it works like in the=
=0A=
world of C where I can use the same libraries (.lib files) to link an=0A=
application either static or dynamically (then requiring runtime libs as=0A=
well), then it is possible to do this. Therefore is is fine for an project=
=0A=
creating such an application at the end of a build chain.=0A=
=0A=
However, if the libraries differ if build with rsl or not, then you will=0A=
create a very bad user experience, because - just as Stephen already said -=
=0A=
the build process will use whatever it finds in the local repository, it=0A=
cannot separate between artifacts built with rsl or without. Your users=0A=
might get a wild mix during build time.=0A=
