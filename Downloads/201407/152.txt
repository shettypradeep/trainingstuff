The Maven group on LinkedIn already has 2090 members and LinkedIn has 
300,000,000 members.

There is also a Meven Developers group with 1,083 members.

I support both but I prefer the more modern approach of LinkedIn as a UI.
I like having all my groups under a single login.

I also support this mailing list even if it is old and has some funny 
interactions with Thunderbird.

I have not had any problems with their business practices and find it a 
good way to maintain business contacts and participate in discussions.
A lot of free and open software are represented in groups on LinkedIn.

I think that you would be hard pressed to find an Apache project that is 
not represented.

There are 285 LinkedIn groups that show up in a search for Apache.
Some are very small and inactive and others are larger and active 
(HADOOP- 11,310 members; Distributed Computing (6,241), Mahout 3,894, 
OpenOffice 1358).

My point is not that everyone should jointhe LinkedIn Maven group but 
for people who don't like mailing lists, there is an alternative that is 
already active.
There is no need to build another forum.
