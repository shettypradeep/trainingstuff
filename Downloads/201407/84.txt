That is the way that Maven works

Way too much work!
This appears to be a normal case that Maven will handle without any fuss.
Have a look at the Maven articles and books.

If you are building something that is very common and do not have any 
truly bizarre development processes, then Maven should be able to handle 
your process in a simple way.

The danger of asking very detailed questions here without providing 
context is that there are very smart and creative people in this forum 
who can make Maven do damn-near anything.
They might take your question a bit too literally and actually provide a 
very elegant solution to a problem that is only slightly misstated.
