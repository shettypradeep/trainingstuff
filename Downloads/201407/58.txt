There are a number of books (free and for purchase) and articles that 
might help you get up to speed very quickly and give you some ideas 
about "Best Practices"

We all use 3rd party jars (70+ in one of our projects) and Maven makes 
this easy.

You declare a dependency on the jar in your POM.
Eclipse with Maven support will automatically make the dependency 
available in the editor and the build.
We use Eclipse/STS which comes ready to go with all the plug-ins that 
one needs for maven, already loaded.
