As a member of the Apache Maven PMC, one of my duties is to foster the
community AT Apache. That means the mailing lists.

If you are looking for an official forum (in the original meaning of the
word) to discuss Maven and its usage, then users@m.a.o is the place to do
that. We cannot stop people who want to discuss Maven elsewhere, nor do we
want to stop them. But we do want to encourage everyone who is discussing
Maven to do so on an Apache hosted mailing list.
