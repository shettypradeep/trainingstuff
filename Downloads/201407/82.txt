There is a LinkedIn Maven User group with  2084 members 
http://www.linkedin.com/groups?gid=1940051

It is not as active as it could be but is available for use.
Is a way to have discussions that are easier to manage over a longer term.

Many of the key resources in this forum are also in the LinkedIn group.

This has no cost to Apache or any member nor does it require any 
additional effort to the PMS or members of the user list to post 
questions and discussions (specially if you know how to use copy and paste).

It does remove a bit of the anonymity of a mailing list but does give 
people a chance to look at profiles to judge the experience of the 
people asking questions or giving answers.

It also tracks the influence of people in the group but does not make 
that public which would be helpful.
